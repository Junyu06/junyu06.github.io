### Problem

Cloud-based SaaS tools for internal workflows incur recurring API costs and raise data privacy concerns for sensitive business operations. Non-technical teams need support for long-form customer inquiries and internal workflows.

### Approach

- Designed and deployed an internal LLM-powered language understanding and summarization system used daily by non-technical teams to support long-form customer inquiries and internal workflows
- Built a fault-tolerant LLM pipeline with schema-constrained generation (Pydantic), ensuring deterministic and reliable structured outputs for downstream business logic rather than brittle free-form text
- Optimized the system for local, on-prem inference on idle hardware to reduce recurring API costs and keep sensitive business data off external SaaS platforms, balancing cost, latency, and reliability tradeoffs
- Owned the end-to-end lifecycle of the internal AI system, including design, implementation, deployment, and ongoing iteration based on real usage, focusing on long-context handling and failure recovery
- In parallel, managed and maintained core office IT infrastructure (networking, CCTV, routers, Wi-Fi, and devices), including early-stage technical setup during company formation and ongoing operational support

### Results

- Reduced recurring API costs by moving to on-prem deployment
- Production-grade stability for internal workflows with fault tolerance and self-repair
- Daily use by non-technical teams for customer inquiries and internal workflows

### Tech Stack

Python, Pydantic, local LLM deployment, Docker, fault-tolerant pipelines, on-prem inference
