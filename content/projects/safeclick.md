### Problem

Traditional ML or LLM-only approaches fail in phishing detection due to sparse signals, zero-day variants, and unreliable external evidence. Users need a security-focused system that operates under real-world constraints.

### Approach

- Design and implement a security-focused phishing detection system built to operate under real-world constraints where traditional approaches fail
- Responsibility centers on the core AI pipeline: multi-stage URL analysis, constrained LLM reasoning, and deterministic risk scoring to ensure safe decisions even when evidence is incomplete or upstream services degrade
- Engineer the system with an emphasis on reliability, failure modes, and cost control rather than model novelty — treating LLMs as probabilistic components that must be constrained, validated, and supported by caching, deduplication, and explicit fallback logic
- Project originated from a hackathon prototype and is being iteratively engineered toward a production-ready security service, with a strong focus on system boundaries, observability, and operational robustness

### Results

- 1st Place Winner and Most Secure Project Award, Hofstra-Pensar Hackathon
- Production-ready security service architecture with system boundaries and observability

### Tech Stack

Python, Pydantic, LLM orchestration, multi-stage URL analysis, caching, deduplication
