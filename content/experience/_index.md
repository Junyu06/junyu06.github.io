## SafeClick — Hempstead, NY
**Software Engineer** (Applied AI & Security) · April 2025 – Present

- Work on the design and implementation of a security-focused phishing detection system built to operate under real-world constraints where traditional ML or LLM-only approaches fail due to sparse signals, zero-day variants, and unreliable external evidence.
- Responsibility centers on the core AI pipeline, including multi-stage URL analysis, constrained LLM reasoning, and deterministic risk scoring to ensure safe decisions even when evidence is incomplete or upstream services degrade.
- Engineered the system with an emphasis on reliability, failure modes, and cost control rather than model novelty — treating LLMs as probabilistic components that must be constrained, validated, and supported by caching, deduplication, and explicit fallback logic.
- Project originated from a hackathon prototype and is being iteratively engineered toward a production-ready security service, with a strong focus on system boundaries, observability, and operational robustness.

## Belle SPA Inc — Huntington, NY
**IT Support Specialist** · Internal AI Tools & Automation · May 2023 – Present

- Designed and deployed an internal LLM-powered language understanding and summarization system used daily by non-technical teams to support long-form customer inquiries and internal workflows.
- Built a fault-tolerant LLM pipeline with schema-constrained generation (Pydantic), ensuring deterministic and reliable structured outputs for downstream business logic rather than brittle free-form text.
- Optimized the system for local, on-prem inference on idle hardware to reduce recurring API costs and keep sensitive business data off external SaaS platforms, balancing cost, latency, and reliability tradeoffs.
- Owned the end-to-end lifecycle of the internal AI system, including design, implementation, deployment, and ongoing iteration based on real usage, focusing on long-context handling and failure recovery.
- In parallel, managed and maintained core office IT infrastructure (networking, CCTV, routers, Wi-Fi, and devices), including early-stage technical setup during company formation and ongoing operational support.

## L&J SPA Inc — Commack, NY
**IT Support Specialist** · September 2019 – January 2023

- Served as the sole technical owner for on-premise systems at a local small business, with no dedicated IT team or external support.
- Maintained and troubleshot core infrastructure including routing, WiFi, and CCTV systems to ensure uninterrupted daily operations.
- Diagnosed and resolved system issues end-to-end, balancing reliability, cost, and operational constraints in a resource-limited environment.
