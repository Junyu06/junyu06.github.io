**Software Engineer — LLM Orchestration & Production AI**  
New York, NY

---

**Treat LLMs as unreliable components** — and design guardrails so they never cause silent corruption.

---

**Key pillars**

- **Deterministic AI Orchestration** — LLMs as probabilistic components with rigid code boundaries, validation, and fallbacks.
- **Production-Ready Engineering** — Deduplication, multi-level caching, and failure-safe designs that ship to real users.
- **High-Stakes Security** — Zero-day phishing, Web3 threat vectors, and systems where mistakes are not acceptable.

---

* Build production-grade LLM systems with deterministic control, explicit validation, and failure recovery.
* Engineer multi-stage AI workflows for long-context and high-volume processing.
* Optimize cost–latency–reliability trade-offs across inference pipelines.
* Lead small engineering teams from prototype to production systems.
