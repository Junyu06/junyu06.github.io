**Junyu Li** — Applied AI Engineer | LLM Systems & Reliability  
New York, New York, United States

---

### Summary

I'm an Applied AI / Software Engineer focused on building production-oriented LLM systems and reliable backend software that real users can depend on.

My work sits at the intersection of backend engineering, AI/LLM infrastructure, and product-focused development. I enjoy turning ambiguous problems—long documents, messy inputs, unreliable model outputs—into systems that are deterministic, maintainable, and resilient in real-world usage.

Most recently, I led the LLM component of a large-scale summarization pipeline that converts long-form documents (10k–20k words) into structured outputs using a MapReduce-style architecture. I focused on practical system design concerns such as semantic chunking, schema-constrained generation (Pydantic), local LLM deployment, and fault-tolerant, resumable workflows.

Alongside LLM systems, I've built and shipped full-stack and mobile applications using Python, Flask, React Native, Flutter, Docker, and SQL/NoSQL databases, often owning system integration, refactoring, and end-to-end delivery.

I'm especially interested in Applied AI or LLM engineering roles where I can work close to production systems, learn from strong engineering teams, and help build AI-powered products that prioritize reliability, clarity, and real-world constraints over novelty.
